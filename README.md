## Introduction

## Architecture

## Prerequisites

We assume that you'll run the backend using Docker. This minimizes the setup required on your local machine.
Therefore, you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Getting Started

### Development

To run both the frontend and backend in development mode, run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up # Optionally add -d to run in detached mode and --build to rebuild the images.
```

This will start the frontend and backend servers in development mode. Both services will automatically reload when you make changes to their respective code.
